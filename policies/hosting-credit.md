OWG has adopted the following policy for giving credit to supporters who donate hardware or hosting to OSMF. OWG will:

1. Credit everyone on [https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/thanks](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/thanks).
2. On the [http://osm.org/about](http://osm.org/about) page, and in a closeable box on the [front page](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), link to the "Thanks" page
3. On the [http://osm.org/about](http://osm.org/about) page, and in a closeable box on the [front page](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), credit the top 3 donors by equivalent Â£/yr value (currently, UCL, Bytemark and IC), as "Hosting supported by \<donor direct links>, and others \<link to hardware.osm.org/thanks>."
4. Try to publicise new supporters who are donating hardware or hosting from time to time via blog posts, tweets and other publicity channels.
